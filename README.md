    - Consistency: Defining design properties ensures a uniform look and feel across the entire application. This enhances the user experience and brand identity.
    - Collaboration: Clear specifications of colors, typography, and other properties enable seamless communication between designers and developers.
    - Efficiency: Developers can implement designs faster when all properties are predefined, reducing back-and-forth discussions.
    - Scalability: When design properties are standardized, scaling the application or making updates becomes easier without compromising the visual identity.
    - Accessibility: Thoughtfully chosen colors and fonts improve accessibility, ensuring the application is usable for all audiences, including those with visual impairments.
